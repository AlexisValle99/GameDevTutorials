 # Challenge Solution:: Extending the selection logic

 > This tutorial was created with Unity version 2019.2.

A challenge was issued at the end of the [How to select multiple objects based on the center of a collider](https://yecats.github.io/2019/10/26/Select-multiple-objects-based-on-mid-point-of-collider.html) tutorial to extend the mechanic by adding the ability to add/remove objects from an existing selection and clear the selection with a button click. This tutorial walks through how I chose to solve that challenge. Access the tutorial [here](https://yecats.github.io/2019/12/02/Select-multiple-objects-based-on-mid-point-of-collider.html).

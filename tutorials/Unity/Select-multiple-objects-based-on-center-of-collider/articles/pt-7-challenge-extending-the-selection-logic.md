# Challenge: Extending the selection logic

While this logic is a great starting point, it's missing a couple of features that would make it feel more natural. Your challenge, should you choose to accept, is to write functionality that accounts for the following scenarios:

1. Additional characters should be added to the selection when the user is holding down shift and drawing a new box. 
2. Characters should only be unselected if the player pushes the escape button on the keyboard.
